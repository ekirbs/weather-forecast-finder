# weather-forecast-finder

## Description

This is my simpel weather forecast app.  This app will find the current and five-day forecast of any city entered into the search bar.  The search history will be saved when the window is closed, and will be loaded again when the page is loaded again.

I created this program to practice my use of localstorage, api usage, and most relevantly, creating all the variable html data thorugh javascript.  I could have dont this a lot easier using techniques I've already learned, but I wanted to challenge myself to use the capability of creating html content with javascript.  It isn't a perfect application, but I learned a lot by taking the higher road.
