# weather-forecast-finder

## Description

This is my simple weather forecast program.  This program will find the current and five-day forecast of any city entered into the search bar.  The search history will be saved when the window is closed, and will be loaded again when the page is loaded again.

I created this program to practice my use of localstorage, api usage, and most of all, creating all the variable html data thorugh javascript.  I could have comfortably completed this assignment using techniques I've already learned, but I wanted to challenge myself by creating as much as possible with javascript instead of having any html skeleton for the content.  There are a few obvious ways to optimize the code, but the application is fully functional.

The current day and time is displayed in the header at the top.  Below the image, a city name can be entered into the input field and when the button is pressed or the enter key is hit, the current weather will be shown, along with the five-day forecast.  The past search inputs will be saved, and can be pressed to receive the weather information as well.
