# weather-forecast-finder

## Description

This is my simple weather forecast program.  This program will find the current and five-day forecast of any city entered into the search bar.  The search history will be saved when the window is closed, and will be loaded again when the page is loaded again.

I created this program to practice my use of localstorage, api usage, and most of all, creating all the variable html data thorugh javascript.  I could have comfortably completed this assignment using techniques I've already learned, but I wanted to challenge myself by creating as much as possible with javascript instead of having any html skeleton for the content.  I will correct the 2 lingering issues (the icons don't load correctly and the 5-day forecast doesn't load correctly) as soon as possible to make a fully functional application.  It isn't a perfect application, but I learned a lot by taking the higher road.
